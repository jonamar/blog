# About Me

Welcome to my blog! This is a simple, minimalist space where I share my thoughts and ideas.

## About This Site

This blog is built with Jekyll using the "no-style-please" theme. I chose this theme because:

- It's minimal and focuses on content
- It loads extremely fast (only 1KB of CSS!)
- It's accessible and easy to read
- It works well on all devices and screen sizes

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, allowing me to write content locally and push to GitHub to update the blog.
